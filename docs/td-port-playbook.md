# TD-to-RA Port Playbook

**Audience:** future-self and future-claude starting a new TD-entity port. Read this *first* — it covers every dead end we hit during the TDATWR session (2026-05-22) so you don't repeat them.

**Scope:** porting a TD building, weapon, bullet, warhead, anim, or aircraft into our RA-based mod as a fully separated `TDxxxx` entity with TD-faithful runtime behavior and visuals.

**Companion deep-dives:**
- `docs/td-atwr-deep-dive.md` — TDATWR worked example end-to-end
- `docs/td-building-separation-recipe.md` — building-specific separation steps
- `docs/td-audio-routing-recipe.md` — audio MERGE pattern + SFXEVENTSNONLOCALIZED.XML

## 1. The architecture (Option A)

**One sentence:** TD-prefixed entities are still instances of RA's classes (`BuildingClass`, `BulletClass`, etc.) and live in the same heaps for interop, **but every method with TD-vs-RA behavior difference dispatches to a verbatim TD port (`Method_TD()`) gated by an `IsTDPort` flag**.

**Why:** the project aims for 4-faction play (GDI/Nod/Allies/Soviet). Fully parallel TDxxxxClass hierarchies would force shim code for every cross-faction interaction. Option A keeps interop free (everything's still a normal `BuildingClass`/`BulletClass`) while making TD behavior bit-exact.

**What's shared (NOT a leak):** class memory layout, heaps, targeting, save/load, sidebar UI, multiplayer sync, damage application across factions.

**What's NOT shared (must be TD-ported per entity):**
- `BulletClass::AI`, `BulletClass::Unlimbo` (homing, scatter, arming, trail spawn)
- `TechnoClass::Fire_At`, `TechnoClass::Rearm_Delay`, `TechnoClass::Can_Fire` where TD differs
- `BuildingClass::Mission_Attack`, `Mission_Guard`, `Shape_Number`, `Drop_Debris`
- Constructor field semantics that exist in TD but not in RA

**The gate:** add `IsTDPort` flag to the relevant base TypeClass(es) and dispatch at the top of every overridden method:

```cpp
void BulletClass::AI(void) {
    if (Class->IsTDPort) { AI_TD(); return; }
    // existing RA logic continues
}
```

---

## 2. End-to-end recipe (numbered, in order)

For a generic TD entity (adjust for what you're porting — building, bullet, weapon, etc.):

### 2.1 — Read TD source FIRST

Before writing any code, find and read the TD source for:
- The class declaration (`reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/<type>.h`)
- The type instantiation (`reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/<x>data.cpp` — `bdata.cpp` for buildings, `bbdata.cpp` for bullets, etc.)
- The dispatch sites in code (`reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/<x>.cpp` — `building.cpp`, `bullet.cpp`, etc.)

Per [[feedback-review-td-source-first]]: TD source is the spec. Don't reverse-engineer from RA half-implementations.

**And our own planning docs are NOT the spec.** `weapon-ports.md`, `catalogue.md`, and the manifest tables are convenience summaries that have been WRONG — `weapon-ports.md` listed E1's weapon as RIFLE (it's `WEAPON_M16`) and the Commando's as M16 (it's `WEAPON_RIFLE`, a 125-dmg `BULLET_SNIPER`). **Every entity gets a full source-driven comparison:** build its chain from `tiberiandawn/const.cpp` `Weapons[]` / `Warheads[]` + the entity's own ctor (`idata.cpp` / `udata.cpp` / `bdata.cpp`) + the `BulletTypeClass` in `bbdata.cpp`, then compare *every value* — damage, ROF, range, bullet, warhead, report, speed, ownable, stats — against the RA equivalent. "RA has a weapon/unit by that name" is **never** sufficient (TDGTWR's Vulcan, TDE1's M16-vs-M1Carbine, the Commando's RIFLE all proved it). Default to porting the TD version; reuse only a TD-ported entity you've confirmed byte-identical (TD→TD).

### 2.2 — Run the chain audit (MANDATORY before any rules.ini edit)

Per [[feedback-td-building-chain-audit-ritual]], dump the full chain visibly:

```
Chain audit — [TDXXXX]:
  Primary=<Weapon>                     [TD-prefixed ✓ / RA-vanilla LEAK]
    Projectile=<Bullet>                [TD-prefixed ✓ / LEAK]
    Warhead=<Warhead>                  [TD-prefixed ✓ / LEAK]
    Report=<Audio>                     [TD-prefixed ✓ / shared/LEAK]
    Anim=<Anim>                        [TD-prefixed ✓ / LEAK]
    Burst=<n>                          [matches TD IsTwoShooter? ✓ / leak]
  Secondary=...                        [same audit if present]
```

Any RA-vanilla section in the chain = must port (don't ship leaks).

### 2.3 — Add enum + heap registration (DLL-side)

Adding a new `[TDSection]` is **never pure rules.ini**. The heap allocator silently fails for unregistered types (per [[project-mod-type-heap-sizing]]). Each new entity needs:

| Section type | Enum entry | Explicit registration |
|---|---|---|
| Bullet `[TDxxx]` | `BULLET_TDxxx` before `BULLET_COUNT` in `defines.h` | `new BulletTypeClass("TDxxx")` in `bbdata.cpp::Init_Heap` |
| Warhead `[TDxxx]` | `WARHEAD_TDxxx` before `WARHEAD_COUNT` in `defines.h` | `new WarheadTypeClass("TDxxx")` in `rules.cpp:~651` |
| Weapon `[TDxxx]` | `WEAPON_TDxxx` before `WEAPON_COUNT` in `defines.h` | `new WeaponTypeClass("TDxxx")` in `rules.cpp:~710` |
| Building `[TDxxx]` | `STRUCT_TDxxx` before `STRUCT_COUNT` in `defines.h` | `static BuildingTypeClass const ClassTdXxx(...)` in `bdata.cpp` + heap registration; `MAX_BUILDING_TYPES = STRUCT_COUNT + 50` already covers this |
| Unit | `UNIT_TDxxx` before `UNIT_COUNT` | `static UnitTypeClass const ClassTdXxx(...)` in `udata.cpp` |
| Aircraft | `AIRCRAFT_TDxxx` before `AIRCRAFT_COUNT` | `static AircraftTypeClass const ClassTdXxx(...)` in `aadata.cpp` |
| Anim | `ANIM_TDxxx` before `ANIM_COUNT` | `static AnimTypeClass const ClassTdXxx(...)` in `adata.cpp` |
| Infantry | `INFANTRY_TDxxx` before `INFANTRY_COUNT` | `static InfantryTypeClass const ClassTdXxx(...)` in `idata.cpp` |

**Symptom of forgetting:** placement crashes (NULL pointer in WarheadPtr / BulletPtr / weapon binding on first deref).

### 2.4 — Set `IsTDPort = true` on the TD entity

For bullets/weapons (and any future class with the flag), set this after the `new` call in the registration block:

```cpp
// In bbdata.cpp::Init_Heap after the registrations
BulletTypes.Ptr((int)BULLET_TDxxx)->IsTDPort = true;
```

```cpp
// In rules.cpp after the new WeaponTypeClass("TDxxx") calls
WeaponTypeClass::As_Pointer(Weapon_From_Name("TDxxx"))->IsTDPort = true;
```

`IsTDPort` is **not** parseable from rules.ini — it's an engine-level dispatch gate, not a tunable.

### 2.5 — Author rules.ini with TD-source raw values

For TD-port weapons: **`Speed=` is raw MPHType** when the weapon is `IsTDPort=true` (see §3.1). Use values directly from TD source:
- `MPH_ROCKET = 60` → `Speed=60`
- `MPH_VERY_FAST = 100` → `Speed=100`
- `MPH_LIGHT_SPEED = 255` → `Speed=255`

For non-TD-port (RA-vanilla) weapons: `Speed=` is a 0-100 percentage, convert via `raw * 100 / 256`.

Add a comment in rules.ini citing the TD source location so the value is traceable:

```ini
; Speed=60 is TD's raw MPH_ROCKET (tiberiandawn/defines.h:627).
; TDTowTwo is flagged IsTDPort=true in rules.cpp so WeaponTypeClass::Read_INI
; parses this as raw MPHType (TD source convention).
Speed=60
```

### 2.6 — Bundle the assets via the vanilla MEG pipeline

Don't use TD-Assets workshop content as the source — our mod must be self-contained. Use vanilla MEG extraction:

**For buildings** (use `scripts/bundle_assets.py`):
```bash
scripts/bundle_assets.py TDxxx
```
Handles ZIP extraction, TD-prefix internal rename, RA_STRUCTURES.XML patch, RABUILDABLES.XML cameo block.

**For bullets** (manual — no bundler script yet):
```bash
# 1. Extract from vanilla MEG
python3 scripts/meg_extract.py extract \
  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/CnCRemastered/Data/TEXTURES_TD_SRGB.MEG \
  "<NAME>" /tmp/td-extract/

# 2. Repack with TD-prefixed internal TGAs
python3 -c "
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'scripts')
from bundle_assets import repack_zip_with_prefix
repack_zip_with_prefix(
    '/tmp/td-extract/<NAME>.ZIP',
    'resources/remaster_mods/Vanilla_RA/Data/ART/TEXTURES/SRGB/RED_ALERT/VFX/TD<NAME>.ZIP',
    '<name>', 'td<name>')
"

# 3. Patch RA_VFX.XML with 32 shape entries (use the patching pattern from
#    bundle_assets.py:215-241 as the model)
```

**For all entities**, the registration XML must be in CONFIG.MEG-override format (full `<Tilesets><TilesetTypeClass name="RA_VFX">...</TilesetTypeClass></Tilesets>` envelope). Mod-additions format (`<Tiles>` only) **doesn't get loaded by the launcher** — confirmed empirically. Always patch the existing `RA_VFX.XML` / `RA_STRUCTURES.XML` / `RA_UNITS.XML` (extracted from CONFIG.MEG) rather than creating standalone XMLs.

### 2.7 — Apply the donor-ImageData pattern (CRITICAL for bullets/anims/aircraft)

Per [[reference-mfcd-donor-imagedata-pattern]] — without this, the missile/anim/plane will be invisible even with the tileset registered correctly.

In the relevant `One_Time()` after the standard SHP-loading loop, copy a vanilla donor's `ImageData` pointer:

```cpp
// bbdata.cpp::BulletTypeClass::One_Time, after the standard loop
BulletTypeClass const& donor = As_Reference(BULLET_HEAT_SEEKER);  // any visible vanilla bullet
BulletTypeClass& tdxxx = As_Reference(BULLET_TDxxx);
if (tdxxx.ImageData == NULL) {
    ((void const*&)tdxxx.ImageData) = donor.ImageData;
}
```

Same for `aadata.cpp` (aircraft, donor `AIRCRAFT_BADGER`), `adata.cpp` (anims, donor `ANIM_FBALL1`).

**Buildings DON'T need this** — they bypass the SHP path entirely in Remastered mode.

### 2.8 — Port TD's verbatim function bodies

For every method on the entity's class that has TD-vs-RA divergence:
1. Read TD's body in `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/<file>.cpp`
2. Create `Method_TD()` next to RA's `Method()`
3. Port TD's body line-for-line, with **inline comments** at every symbol rename or RA-plumbing addition
4. Dispatch from `Method()`: `if (Class->IsTDPort) { Method_TD(); return; }` at the top

**Common symbol renames TD→RA** (record in port doc):
- `Class->Warhead` (TD class-level) → `Class->ClassWarhead` (we added this field to avoid RA collision)
- `Class->Explosion` → `Class->ImpactAnim` (we added — RA's `Explosion=` is on warheads not bullets)
- `Class->Range` (TD bullet field) → `Class->BulletRange` (avoid weapon `Range=` collision)
- `Class->MaxSpeed` (TD class-level) → instance `MaxSpeed` (RA stores per-instance from weapon)
- `Altitude` (TD) → `Height` (RA)
- `GRAVITY` (TD #define) → `Rule.Gravity` (RA runtime-config)
- `Delete_This()` (TD method) → `delete this` (RA idiom)
- `MIN/MAX` macros → `min/max` (RA's std-style)
- TD's `BULLET_TOW` enum value → `BULLET_SSM` (our TD-port BulletType)
- TD's `BULLET_BULLET` / `BULLET_GRENADE` / `BULLET_NAPALM` — commented placeholders (no TD-port for these)

### 2.9 — Audio routing (if needed)

Per [[project-td-audio-routing-recipe]]: MERGE the base `SFXEVENTSNONLOCALIZED.XML`, never replace. Add VOC_TD_* enum entries. Bundle WAVs in `Data/AUDIO/`.

### 2.10 — Verify with the chain-audit ritual repeated

After all changes, run the chain audit again. Every line should show `[TD-prefixed ✓]`. Zero LEAKs.

### 2.11 — Build, deploy, smoke-test

- Build: `cmake --workflow --preset remaster` (with toolchain env per CLAUDE.md)
- Deploy: `./deploy.sh --yes`
- Smoke-test by placing the entity in-game on the Deck

### 2.12 — Side-by-side verification vs actual TD

Place the entity on our Deck. Run actual TD on the second Deck. Compare:
- Build animation sequence
- Idle visual
- Firing visual (sprite, sound, salvo count, salvo cadence)
- Damage / impact behavior
- Death / sell sequence
- Any state-machine animations (charge-up, recoil, etc.)

---

## 3. The N traps that will catch you (with fixes)

### 3.1 — `Speed=` parsing convention differs TD vs RA

**Trap:** TD source has `MaxSpeed = MPH_ROCKET = 60` (raw 0-255 value). RA's `Get_MPHType` interprets `Speed=N` from rules.ini as a 0-100 *percentage* scaled to 0-256. Copying `Speed=60` from TD source into a vanilla RA-style weapon gives MaxSpeed=153 (= 60% × 255), **not** 60.

**Symptom (moderate raw values like 60):** missiles 2.5× too fast, overshoot during arming, fail to hit close-range targets (Timer expires before proximity fuse triggers).

**Symptom (raw value of 100, intending MPH_VERY_FAST):** *Worse and very misleading.* `Speed=100` parses as 100% → MaxSpeed=255=MPH_LIGHT_SPEED. In `Unlimbo_TD` (bullet.cpp:1022-1023) this triggers `if (speed == MPH_LIGHT_SPEED) speed = MPH_IMMOBILE;` — bullet velocity becomes 0. Bullet sits at the launcher, fuse expires after a few frames, the AA-distance damage branch (bullet.cpp:1268, `Distance(TarCom) < 0x80`) is skipped because the bullet is nowhere near the aircraft, and the impact anim plays on top of the firer. Player sees: missile emerges from turret, vanishes immediately, 0 damage. Looks like a rendering or warhead bug; is actually this Speed= bug. TDSAM/TDNike hit this 2026-05-25.

**Fix:** add `IsTDPort` flag on `WeaponTypeClass`. In `Read_INI`, branch:
```cpp
if (IsTDPort) {
    MaxSpeed = (MPHType)ini.Get_Int(Name(), "Speed", (int)MaxSpeed);  // raw
} else {
    MaxSpeed = ini.Get_MPHType(Name(), "Speed", MaxSpeed);  // percentage
}
```

Already implemented in `weapon.cpp:202-210`. Just flag your new TD weapon and write the raw TD-source value.

See [[reference-ra-mphtype-ini-format]].

### 3.2 — Type-heap registration silently fails

**Trap:** Adding `[TDxxx]` to rules.ini without adding the enum + explicit `new XxxTypeClass("TDxxx")` registration in the right `data.cpp` or `rules.cpp`.

**Symptom:** crash on placement (NULL pointer when the weapon/bullet/warhead is dereferenced).

**Fix:** §2.3 table above. Every section type needs enum entry + explicit registration.

See [[project-mod-type-heap-sizing]].

### 3.3 — Donor ImageData pattern for non-building entities

**Trap:** Bullets / anims / aircraft with TGA-only assets (no `.SHP` in any MIX file) have `Class->ImageData == NULL` after `One_Time` runs. `Draw_It` bails at `if (!shapeptr) return;` and the entity is invisible.

**Symptom:** entity behaves correctly (audio, damage, animation trail), but its body sprite is invisible. For bullets specifically: smoke trail visible, missile body absent.

**Fix:** Copy a vanilla donor's `ImageData` pointer in `One_Time` after the loop (§2.7).

See [[reference-mfcd-donor-imagedata-pattern]].

### 3.4 — Tileset XML format and location

**Trap:** Standalone `TDxxx.XML` files in `TILESETS/<KIND>/` subdirs **are not loaded** by the launcher. Mod-additions format (`<Tiles>...</Tiles>` without `<Tilesets><TilesetTypeClass>` envelope) **also not loaded** as standalone files.

**Symptom:** asset registration appears correct but the entity's sprite/visual doesn't render.

**Fix:** Always patch the CONFIG.MEG-extracted base XML (`RA_VFX.XML`, `RA_STRUCTURES.XML`, `RA_UNITS.XML`) and ship the patched copy in `resources/.../Data/XML/TILESETS/`. The launcher overrides the CONFIG.MEG version with the mod's. Full `<Tilesets><TilesetTypeClass name="RA_VFX"><RootTexturePath>Red_Alert\VFX</RootTexturePath><Tiles>...` envelope required.

### 3.5 — Buildings don't have `IsTwoShooter` field

**Trap:** TD's `STRUCT_ATOWER` has `IsTwoShooter=true` in its constructor. RA's `BuildingTypeClass` constructor has no such field. Naive ports leave salvo count as 1.

**Fix:** Use `Burst=2` on the weapon (RA's mechanism — `WeaponTypeClass.Burst > 1` makes `Is_Two_Shooter()` return true, which triggers the `IsSecondShot` toggle in `Fire_At`). Engine path works correctly; just set the weapon flag instead of building flag.

**Verified working** for TDATWR via `[TDTowTwo] Burst=2` — produces 2 missiles per engagement, 2 audio pings.

### 3.6 — `Rearm_Delay` timing TD-vs-RA

**Trap:** TD's `Rearm_Delay` returns 9 (short, first-shot-in-salvo) and ROF+3 (long, between salvos). RA's returns 3 and ROF respectively. Naive ports get tighter salvo cadence than TD.

**Fix:** Already implemented in `techno.cpp:3096-3119` — `Rearm_Delay` branches on `weapon->IsTDPort` and uses TD's 9 / ROF+3 timing for TD-port weapons.

### 3.7 — Smoke trail vs missile sprite

**Trap:** TD bullets with `Animates=yes` spawn `ANIM_SMOKE_PUFF` as the trail. This happens in `BulletClass::AI` regardless of whether `ImageData` is set. So the trail can be visible while the sprite is invisible (per §3.3).

**Don't confuse:** trail visible ≠ sprite visible. Test both independently.

### 3.8 — RA-only enum values in TD-port code

**Trap:** TD's `bullet.cpp::AI` references `BULLET_TOW`, `BULLET_SAM`, `BULLET_BULLET`, `BULLET_GRENADE`, `BULLET_NAPALM` for special-case behavior. RA's enum has different names.

**Fix:** Map TD enum values to closest RA equivalent (or comment as placeholder if no equivalent exists). Common mappings:
- `BULLET_TOW` → `BULLET_SSM` (our TDSSM is the TD-port equivalent)
- `BULLET_SAM` → `BULLET_AAMISSILE` (closest RA equivalent)
- `BULLET_BULLET` → comment-only (no TD-port for small-arms invisible bullet yet)

### 3.9 — Build pipeline: POST_BUILD copy skipped on incremental builds

**Trap:** `./deploy.sh --no-build` skips the build entirely AND skips the `resources/` → `build/` copy step. Pure rules.ini edits don't make it to the deploy bundle.

**Trap variant:** running `./deploy.sh --yes` (with build) AFTER recent successful build: ninja considers the DLL up-to-date, skips relink, and the CMake `POST_BUILD` resources-copy step doesn't fire because it's tied to the DLL link.

**Fix:** `touch redalert/<any>.cpp` before deploy to force a relink and trigger the staging step.

### 3.10 — No RA-engine logic for TD entities

**Trap:** When debugging TD-port behavior, falling back to "tune the rules.ini value harder" or "find which RA flag/scatter constant gets us close." Drift.

**Fix:** Per [[feedback-no-donor-for-td-separation]] / [[feedback-td-building-chain-audit-ritual]]: when TD-port runtime behavior differs from TD, the answer is **port TD's engine code body** into a `_TD()` variant. Patching RA's native function with TD-flavored tweaks is the donor anti-pattern at the engine level.

The exception is plumbing the launcher requires (e.g. `Map.Submit` for layer system, `Height` init for flight altitude tracking). Flag those inline with comments.

### 3.11 — Separated TD building doesn't satisfy vanilla-RA prerequisites

**Trap:** Aircraft/units that require a vanilla RA building (e.g. helicopters require `STRUCT_HELIPAD`, RA Allied/Soviet infantry require `STRUCT_TENT` / `STRUCT_BARRACKS`, vehicles require `STRUCT_WEAP`) silently disappear from the sidebar when the player builds the TD-separated equivalent (TDHPAD, TDPYLE, TDHAND, TDWEAP/TDAFLD) instead of the vanilla one. The TD building has its own `Type` enum past `STRUCT_COUNT`, so the prereq check `Has_Building_Active(STRUCT_HELIPAD)` returns false even though semantically the player has a helipad.

**Symptom:** Build a TDHPAD, get the free helicopter — but the helicopter cameos never appear in the sidebar. (Or: GDI builds TDPYLE, the Allied infantry roster never unlocks. Etc.)

**Fix:** Extend `HouseClass::Can_Build`'s prerequisite-equivalence block at `house.cpp:1003+`. Add a cached IniName→Type lookup for the new TD building plus a `if (t == STRUCT_VANILLA_NAME && tdNNNN_type >= 0 && Has_Building_Active(tdNNNN_type)) continue;` branch. Worked examples: STRUCT_TENT→TDPYLE, STRUCT_BARRACKS→TDHAND, STRUCT_WEAP→TDWEAP/TDAFLD, STRUCT_HELIPAD→TDHPAD, STRUCT_RADAR→TDHQ, STRUCT_REFINERY→TDPROC, STRUCT_ADVANCED_TECH→TDEYE(GDI)/TDTMPL(Nod).

**⚠️ THE TRAP WITHIN THE TRAP (cost a build cycle 2026-05-28):** Do NOT try to satisfy a prereq by shadowing the vanilla `STRUCTF_*` flag into `House->BScan`/`ActiveBScan`. The prereq check calls `Has_Building_Active(type)`, which tests **`ActiveBQuantity[type] > 0`** — a per-building-type *counter* — NOT the BScan bitmask (`house.h:1008`). So a BScan flag shadow does nothing for prerequisites. (The BScan shadow IS still required for *other* engine checks — radar activation, defeat-on-no-scans `house.cpp:1474`, GPS/superweapon gating — just not prereqs.) Prereqs need the explicit per-type remap above, full stop.

**Per-faction prereqs:** map one vanilla token to BOTH faction equivalents in the same branch so each side's building satisfies it independently — e.g. `STRUCT_ADVANCED_TECH` (`atek`) is satisfied by GDI's TDEYE *or* Nod's TDTMPL (TD's `UnitMCV` requires `STRUCTF_EYE`; `atek` is the closest RA token, and TDHQ basic comm deliberately does NOT count).

**Diagnostic:** `MOD_DEBUG_CANBUILD.txt` (written by the `Can_Build` hook at `house.cpp:877+` for TD-prefixed + `E#` infantry entries) logs `level_ok` / `pre_ok` / `own_ok` per call. `pre=[N,…]` shows the STRUCT enum each token resolved to. Pull it from the Deck to see exactly which gate fails before changing code. (Watch the house filter — AI houses log too; match the player's house number.)

**Why it's silent:** No engine error — `Can_Build` just returns false and the sidebar hides the cameo. This will eventually be replaced by a `BehavesLike=` rules.ini field in D2; until then, every new separated TD building that shadows a vanilla RA factory needs one entry here.

### 3.11b — Audio override mechanics (mod XML vs WAV-file replacement)

Two distinct override paths, validated 2026-05-26 during TD EVA + radar SFX work:

| Asset class | Override mechanism | Side-conditional? |
|---|---|---|
| **VOC sound effects** fired via DLL `Sound_Effect(VOC_TD_*)` | Mod-side `SFXEVENTSNONLOCALIZED.XML` adds new `RAC_SFX_<NAME>` / `RAR_SFX_<NAME>` entries pointing at TD assets. | **Yes** — DLL chooses which VOC enum to fire based on `PlayerPtr->ActLike`. |
| **VOX EVA speech** fired via `Speak(VOX_*)` → `On_Speech` | Mod-side `SFXEVENTSLOCALIZED.XML` adds `LocalizedSFXEvent` entries (engine sends TD-prefixed name; launcher resolves). | **Yes** — `On_Speech` chooses Speech[]→SpeechTD[] based on `player_ptr->ActLike`. See §3.12 routing recipe below. |
| **Launcher-owned SFX** (radar on/off, ambient UI) | Mod-side WAV with same filename as launcher's hardcoded sample (case-insensitive) in `DATA/AUDIO/`. Reillsss CnCinRA precedent. | **No.** Launcher's state-driven SFX dispatch happens entirely client-side; DLL's `Radar_Activate()` isn't called in REMASTER_BUILD. SFXEvent XML override of existing same-named entries doesn't load either — mod XML is additive-only for SFXEvents. The WAV-file swap is global (all sides). Side-conditional requires launcher source modification. |

**Test sequence** to identify which class you're dealing with: drop a diagnostic `fprintf` into the DLL hook (Sound_Effect call site, Speak call site, or the state-change function). If the log fires → DLL-driven, side-conditional is achievable. If silent → launcher-driven, WAV-file replacement is your only mod-side lever.

### 3.12 — `Who_Can_Build_Me` evicts cameos right after `Can_Build` adds them

**Trap:** §3.11's prereq equivalence makes `Can_Build` return true and `Update_Buildables` calls `Sidebar_Glyphx_Add` successfully — but the cameo still doesn't appear (or appears for one frame then vanishes). The next `Sidebar_Glyphx_Recalc` tick (called every `Glyphx_Queue_AI` from `dllinterface.cpp:1990`) runs `StripClass::Recalc` → `tech->Who_Can_Build_Me(true, false, house) != NULL`. If that returns NULL, the entry is evicted.

`ObjectTypeClass::Who_Can_Build_Me` (`object.cpp:2403+`) iterates buildings and checks `building->Class->ToBuild == RTTI`. That check passes for TD-separated factories. **But** the function then has a "HACK ALERT" branch at `object.cpp:2436-2443` that hardcodes `STRUCT_HELIPAD` and `STRUCT_AIRSTRIP` to restrict aircraft to the matching factory kind:

```cpp
if (What_Am_I() == RTTI_AIRCRAFTTYPE) {
    AircraftTypeClass* air = (AircraftTypeClass*)this;
    if ((*building == STRUCT_HELIPAD && !air->IsFixedWing)
        || (*building == STRUCT_AIRSTRIP && air->IsFixedWing)) {
        ...
    }
}
```

A separated `STRUCT_TDHPAD` fails the `*building == STRUCT_HELIPAD` test — Recalc evicts every rotary cameo.

**Symptom:** Cameos appear briefly then disappear, OR (in practice) never visible because Recalc fires before the first paint. Logs show `Sidebar_Glyphx_Add` reporting `added=1` for HELI but the launcher's sidebar stays empty.

**Fix:** Extend the hardcoded check to include the separated equivalent:
```cpp
if (((*building == STRUCT_HELIPAD || *building == STRUCT_TDHPAD) && !air->IsFixedWing)
    || (*building == STRUCT_AIRSTRIP && air->IsFixedWing)) {
```

**Why it's a sister-bug to §3.11:** Two hardcoded RA-side paths gate cameo visibility — `HouseClass::Can_Build` (add) and `ObjectTypeClass::Who_Can_Build_Me` (don't evict). Adding §3.11's equivalence without §3.12's fix gives you cameos that get added then immediately stripped. Always patch both whenever a TD-separated building shadows a vanilla RA factory role (helipad, airstrip, future barracks/weapon-factory equivalents). TDAFLD hit the same shape of bug and resolved it via `Find_Docking_Bay`'s IniName fallback — the underlying lesson is identical.

### 3.13 — Donor BSIZE/footprint parity check (TDWEAP shortcut trap)

**Trap:** §2.2 of the recipe says "copy the donor's constructor verbatim" with a table mapping TDxxx → RA donor (e.g., TDWEAP → ClassWeapon). The implicit assumption is donor footprint ≈ TD footprint. **For TDWEAP, that's false:** RA's WEAP is `BSIZE_32` (3×2, no overlap), but TD's WEAP is `BSIZE_33` (3×3 with row-0 overlap). Copying RA's `ClassWeapon` verbatim gave a building wearing the wrong-sized footprint — the Remastered TGA tileset is sized for 3×3 and renders partially / mispositioned against a 3×2 engine origin.

**Symptom:** Body sprite renders truncated, displaced, or with the top cut off. Bib draws at the smaller footprint but the launcher's sprite occupies a wider area.

**Fix:** Before copying the donor verbatim, **diff TD source `BSIZE_*` + footprint arrays against the RA donor's**. If they differ, define `TdList<N>` / `TdExitList<N>` arrays locally (mirroring TD source verbatim) and use `BSIZE_xx` from TD source. Worked example: `bdata.cpp` `TdListWeap`/`TdOListWeap`/`TdExitWeap` for STRUCT_TDWEAP, `TdList42`/`TdExitAirstrip` for STRUCT_TDAFLD.

**Audit checklist** (run before any TDxxx building port):
- `BSIZE_*` in TD ClassXxx == RA donor ClassXxx?
- `ListXxx` cells in TD's bdata.cpp == RA's?
- `OListXxx` overlap row in TD's bdata.cpp == RA's (often `NULL` in RA but populated in TD for buildings with roof overhang)?
- `ExitXxx` exit-cell preference list in TD's bdata.cpp == RA's?

### 3.14 — Overlay SHP (WEAP2-style door layer) shipping gap

**Trap:** §7 of the recipe lists body SHP + buildup SHP (`OBLI.SHP:TDOBLI.SHP` + `OBLIMAKE.SHP:TDOBLIMAKE.SHP`) but doesn't mention overlay SHPs like `WEAP2.SHP`. War-factory-style buildings render in two layers: body (foundation/ramp) + overlay (walls/roof with door animation). RA's engine has a single global `BuildingTypeClass::WarFactoryOverlay` static loaded from `"WEAP2.SHP"` and drawn on top of every STRUCT_WEAP/FAKEWEAP. After STRUCT_TDWEAP separation, that single static still pointed at RA's WEAP2 — drawing RA's hangar roof on top of TD's body in classic mode → looked like a hybrid building.

**Symptom:** Classic-mode rendering shows TD foundation + RA roof (or vice versa). In Remastered mode the launcher tileset XML can swap the asset name, but classic mode uses the raw SHP pointer.

**Fix:** Add a TD-specific static pointer (e.g., `WarFactoryOverlayTd`) loaded from the TD-prefixed SHP in `One_Time`. Ship the TD overlay SHP into TFASSETS.MIX (`WEAP2.SHP:TDWEAP2.SHP`). In `Draw_It`, dispatch the overlay pointer + asset name in lockstep based on building type. Plus: the TGA tileset XML for the overlay must have shape entries matching TD's `Open_Door(rate, stages)` call — see §3.15.

### 3.15 — TGA tileset shape count must match TD's `Open_Door(rate, stages)`

**Trap:** RA's `WEAP2.SHP` is sized for `Open_Door(8, 5)` → 4 stages (Door_Stage returns 0..3) + 4 damaged. Eight XML shape entries total. TD's `WEAP2.SHP` has 20 frames sized for `Open_Door(2, 11)` → 10 stages (Door_Stage 0..9) + 10 damaged. If the XML uses RA's 8-shape mapping but the code calls TD's `Open_Door(2, 11)`, shapes 8/9 + 10..19 fall outside the XML mapping → **launcher renders white squares for those frames**.

**Symptom:** Door animation works for the first few frames, then the top half goes white/transparent during the second half of the open animation and damaged states. Body renders fine — only the overlay breaks.

**Fix:** Build the TDxxx2 XML with shape entries 1:1 to the TGA frame count, matching TD's stages parameter. For an 11-stage door with 20 TGA frames: shapes 0..9 → frames 0000..0009 (normal opening), shapes 10..19 → frames 0010..0019 (damaged variants). Replace any sample-remap from the alias era (gotcha #13 in `docs/adding-td-buildings.md`).

### 3.16 — `Health_Ratio() < 0x0080` is broken on RA's `fixed` type

**Trap:** TD source uses `if (Health_Ratio() < 0x0080) shapenum += N;` (or similar) for damaged-state shape offsets. TD's `Health_Ratio()` returns `int` in 0..0xFF range, so `< 0x80` literally means "below 50%". Copying that line verbatim into RA breaks: RA's `Health_Ratio()` returns `fixed`, and `fixed::operator<(int)` (`common/fixed.h:247`) multiplies the int by `PRECISION = 65536`. So `Health_Ratio() < 0x0080` becomes `Data.Raw < (128 * 65536)` — **always true** for any health ratio between 0 and 1.

**Symptom:** Building always renders as if damaged. Body might still look OK because Door_Stage()=0 + offset=N falls within the SHP range, but you'll see the damaged-variant sprite at full health. Easy to spot in side-by-side TD-vs-our-port comparison.

**Fix:** Translate to RA-idiomatic compare: `if (Health_Ratio() <= Rule.ConditionYellow) shapenum += N;`. `Rule.ConditionYellow = fixed(1, 2) = 0.5` by default (rules.ini-configurable). Semantically equivalent to TD's `< 0x0080`. Already documented in `docs/td-tier1-verification.md:231` by example; codify it here so it's caught earlier.

### 3.17 — `deploy.sh --no-build` can silently skip XML/MIX changes

**Trap:** When you only change an XML or MIX file (no DLL rebuild needed), `./deploy.sh --no-build` may rsync the build artifacts without including the resources tree, or rsync's mtime-based skip can swallow the change. Symptom: code expects updated XML mappings or MIX contents, but the launcher still uses the old version.

**Fix:** After modifying XML/MIX, verify on the Deck with `grep -c '<NewEntryName>'` or `python3 scripts/mix_tools.py list ...` against the deployed path. If the count doesn't match local, force-push with explicit `scp <localpath> deck@steamdeck:<deckpath>`. Worked example: TDWEAP2 XML expansion from 8 to 20 shape entries needed a force-scp when the standard deploy skipped it.

### 3.18 — `#ifdef FIXIT_HELI_LANDING` is INACTIVE — check active branch

**Trap:** `defines.h:106` has `//#define FIXIT_HELI_LANDING` (commented out). Code wrapped in `#ifdef FIXIT_HELI_LANDING` is **dead**. The active branch is `#else`. If you add a fix to the `#ifdef` block and it doesn't take effect, you've patched the wrong branch. Originally caught while debugging the multi-plane TDAFLD convoy: an `intheory=true` retry was added to `Place_Object`'s helicopter fallback under `#ifdef` and the queue stayed blocked until the fix moved to the `#else`.

**Fix:** When editing `HouseClass::Place_Object` or any other code with this guard, **always check whether the `#ifdef` macro is active in defines.h before patching**. For helicopter/aircraft-related Place_Object work, the active branch is currently `#else`.

### 3.20 — Harvester dock plumbing port (TDPROC) — four-trap composite

Porting TD's BSTATE_ACTIVE → AUX1 → AUX2 refinery cycle requires more than the building-side Mission_Harvest port. Four RA-side gaps trip in sequence:

1. **`UnitClass::Offload_Tiberium_Bail` is an `#ifdef TOFIX` stub.** The return value is wrapped in a never-defined preprocessor block, so it always returns 0 — `Tiberium--` runs (cargo lost) but no credits returned. RA's vanilla refinery uses the one-shot Mission_Unload bulk dump and never calls this method. Fix: port TD's per-bail credit calc, adapted to RA's `Gold`/`Gems` model (`Rule.GemValue` first, then `Rule.GoldValue`; both decrement alongside Tiberium so Gold+Gems == Tiberium stays invariant).

2. **`Per_Cell_Process` RADIO_ATTACH case is empty.** RA's `case RADIO_ATTACH: break;` at `unit.cpp:1742` is a TD-flow stub that never calls `Limbo() + whom->Attach(this)`. For UNIT_TDHARV docking at STRUCT_TDPROC the building's RADIO_IM_IN returns RADIO_ATTACH (TD-verbatim), so this stub keeps the harvester visible at the dock pad with Attached_Object() returning NULL → MIDDLE state has nothing to siphon. Port TD's verbatim `Mark(MARK_UP); Limbo(); whom->Attach(this);` body.

3. **`Cell_Building()` returns NULL for OVERLAP-only cells.** Building registration splits into `Occupy_Down()` (occupier chain — `Cell_Find_Object` walks this) vs `Overlap_Down()` (separate `Overlapper[]` array). RA's IM_IN trigger at `unit.cpp:1737` checks `Map[CELL(cell - MAP_CELL_W)].Cell_Building()` (cell NORTH of harvester) — for the BSIZE_33 TDPROC footprint with row-0 corners as OVERLAP-only, that N-cell hits the Overlapper array and returns NULL. Fix: extend the check for UNIT_TDHARV to use TD's own-cell test (`Map[cell].Cell_Building() == whom`, mirroring `tiberiandawn/unit.cpp:1766`).

4. **`if (Tiberium_Load())` rounds to 0 when ≤13 of 28 bails remain.** RA's `fixed` class has only `operator unsigned()` for implicit numeric conversion — and that operator **rounds to nearest int** (line 114 of `common/fixed.h`). For Rule.BailCount=28, `fixed(13, 28)` rounds to 0, so the bare-conditional bail loop exits with ~12 bails undrained (3 of 7 pips). Same root cause as §3.16's `Health_Ratio()` trap. Fix: explicit `> 0` comparison (`if (techno->Tiberium_Load() > 0)`) — that invokes `fixed::operator>(int)` which inspects `Data.Raw` directly without rounding.

**Symptom of any one missing fix:** Trap 1 + 2 → MIDDLE finds NULL Attached_Object, immediately falls through to AUX2 with no credits. Trap 3 → harvester at dock pad stays visible, IM_IN never sent, same outcome. Trap 4 → trickle starts correctly but stops at ~57% capacity (Tiberium=13). All four must be patched together for a clean TD dock cycle.

**Visual polish (TD-authentic but optional):** UNIT_TDHARV RADIO_BACKUP_NOW handler should do `Force_Track(BACKUP_INTO_REFINERY, Adjacent_Cell(Center_Coord(), FACING_N)) + Set_Speed(128)` rather than RA's instant-IM_IN shortcut, and `Exit_Object` for STRUCT_TDPROC should do `Force_Track(OUT_OF_REFINERY, ...)` rather than instant-respawn. With both, the dock-in back-up and dock-out drive-out animations match TD source exactly.

**See:** TDPROC port worked example in this session (commit at the end of M4 Tier 3). `tiberiandawn/{building.cpp:4488 (Mission_Harvest), building.cpp:2242 (Exit_Object), unit.cpp:557 (RADIO_BACKUP_NOW), unit.cpp:1755-1785 (Per_Cell_Process attach), drive.cpp:1638 (Offload_Tiberium_Bail)}` are the load-bearing TD source sites.

---

### 3.19 — Multi-plane convoy needs three independent fixes (TDAFLD-specific)

**Trap:** Naively porting TD's `Create_Special_Reinforcement` Exit_Object case doesn't produce a working back-to-back cargo plane convoy in RA. RA's engine lacks three pieces that TD source has implicitly:

1. **`Place_Object` radio-contact filter** rejects the airstrip while it's tethered to a prior cargo plane. Fix: `intheory=true` retry for vehicles whose house owns a TDAFLD (mirrors helicopter helipad-busy fallback).
2. **`Do_Reinforcements` SOURCE_AIR override** must spawn AIRCRAFT_TDCARGO at east edge even when Find_Docking_Bay returns NULL (strip busy). Fall back to iterating Buildings list directly to grab any TDAFLD/AIRSTRIP for spawn-position math.
3. **`PICK_AIRSTRIP` state must NOT circle** when RADIO_HELLO is rejected. Set facing toward strip + Set_Speed(0xFF) every tick; retry RADIO_HELLO; transition to FLY_TO_AIRSTRIP when handshake succeeds. The straight-line convoy is the desired feel — circles are an alias-era leftover.

**Symptom of any one missing fix:** Plane #2 doesn't spawn until plane #1 has delivered (factory blocked by radio-contact filter), or plane #2 spawns at house's default edge (north for Nod) and orbits invisibly off-map.

**See:** worked example in `5c0c17e` commit. `docs/cargo-plane-port.md` is the larger reference for the cargo-plane mechanics; this trap is specifically about the queue/multi-plane behavior layered on top of single-plane delivery.

---

### 3.21 — TD building HP is DOUBLED at runtime (the "weak buildings" bug)

**Trap:** TD's `BuildingTypeClass` constructor passes **`strength * 2`** to the `TechnoTypeClass` base (`tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp:3706`; same in EA's shipped `SOURCECODE/TIBERIANDAWN/BDATA.CPP`). So a TD building's listed `STRNTH` in bdata is **half** its real in-game HP. If you copy the raw bdata `STRNTH` into your `[TDxxxx]` rules.ini `Strength=`, the building ships at **half** its authentic durability — the entire faction feels papery.

**RA does NOT double** — `redalert/bdata.cpp` reads `Strength=` literally.

**Scope: buildings ONLY.** `UnitTypeClass`/`InfantryTypeClass`/`AircraftTypeClass` do **not** double; their listed strength is the real HP. (TDMCV/TDHARV/TDC17 were already correct.) This is the only "constructor silently changes the value" transform in TD type data — cost, sight, etc. all pass through.

**Diagnosis (2026-05-28):** Nod Gun Turret (40 dmg AP) took **14** shots to kill a NUKE power plant, not 7. An instrumented `TechnoClass::Take_Damage` damage trace (`MOD_DEBUG_DAMAGE.txt`) showed `str 400->370` — NUKE's listed STRNTH=200 was 400 at runtime. Damage per shot (30 = 40 × 75% AP-vs-wood) was correct; HP was the variable. Verified by building an instrumented `TiberianDawn.dll` from the pristine `tiberiandawn/` tree and running the same test as a TD mod.

**Fix (committed):** replicate the doubling in `redalert/bdata.cpp BuildingTypeClass::Read_INI`, after `TechnoTypeClass::Read_INI`:
```cpp
// TD buildings carry 2x listed HP (tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp:3706); RA does not.
// Keyed on the "TD" IniName prefix; scoped to buildings (units use own Read_INI).
if (Name()[0] == 'T' && Name()[1] == 'D') { MaxStrength *= 2; }
```
rules.ini now holds the **verbatim TD-source STRNTH** and the engine doubles it — consistent with the verbatim-port convention, and auto-applies to every future TD building.

**Sub-trap:** before flipping a blanket multiplier, verify every existing rules.ini value is RAW source. Two buildings were already at the doubled value (TDPROC=900 vs source 450; TDWEAP=1000 vs source 500); the blanket double would have QUADRUPLED them. They were set back to raw (450/500) so the engine lands them at the correct 900/1000.

---

### 3.22 — TD building shadowing a vanilla `STRUCTF_` flag can leak RA-only mechanics

**Trap:** TD-separated buildings (Type > 31) can't represent themselves in the 32-bit `BScan`/`ActiveBScan`, so `building.cpp` shadows each into its closest vanilla `STRUCTF_` bit (e.g. `STRUCT_TDAFLD → STRUCTF_AIRSTRIP`) so defeat/production/urgency checks work. But that same bit may gate an **RA-only mechanic**. TDAFLD's `STRUCTF_AIRSTRIP` shadow unlocked RA's **Spy Plane + Paratroopers** superweapons (`house.cpp Special_Weapons_AI`) — not TD-authentic.

**Fix (committed):** gate the RA-only consumer on owning a *genuine* vanilla building via `Has_Building_Active(STRUCT_AIRSTRIP)` (checks `ActiveBQuantity[type]`, which TDAFLD does NOT increment for STRUCT_AIRSTRIP), not the shadowed bit. Keep the shadow intact for the defeat/production/urgency paths. Note cargo-plane docking never needed the bit — `aircraft.cpp PICK_AIRSTRIP` finds the pad by type (`STRUCT_AIRSTRIP || STRUCT_TDAFLD`).

**General rule:** when you shadow a vanilla `STRUCTF_` flag for a TD building, grep every reader of that flag and ask "does this gate an RA-faction-only feature?" If yes, gate that reader on `Has_Building_Active(<real vanilla type>)`. Relates to §3.11 (BScan-shadow vs ActiveBQuantity prereq split).

---

### 3.23 — Some hotkeys are GlyphX-side and may be unfixable from the DLL (PARKED: MCV deploy)

**Trap:** the in-game **Deploy keyboard shortcut** works for the RA MCV but not `UNIT_TDMCV`, even though every DLL-side deploy path (`What_Action` self, `Try_To_Deploy`, mission AI, `MCV_Deploy_Building`) handles TDMCV. The hotkey lives in the **closed GlyphX C# runtime** (the shipped SOURCECODE only includes the map-editor C#). It is NOT routed through `CNC_Handle_Unit_Request` (no deploy case in our fork or EA's), and `CNCObjectStruct.CanDeploy`/`IsDeployable` are vestigial (never populated by us or EA).

**Status:** PARKED (low priority). Spoofing `CNCObjectStruct.TypeName = "MCV"` for TDMCV did NOT fix it, so GlyphX isn't keying purely on the `TypeName` string. Next spike hypothesis: GlyphX keys on the numeric `DllObjectTypeEnum Type`. Full log in memory `[[project-mcv-deploy-hotkey-spike]]`.

**Lesson:** before chasing a hotkey/UI bug for a TD-ported entity, determine whether the behavior lives in the DLL or GlyphX. If GlyphX, it may be unfixable from the mod side (cf. §3.x classic-mode spacebar limitation). Confirm the keying mechanism before investing time.

---

### 3.24 — TD infantry are INVISIBLE without a donor-ImageData fallback (idata.cpp gap)

**Trap:** §3.3 / [[reference-mfcd-donor-imagedata-pattern]] applies to **infantry too**, but `InfantryTypeClass::One_Time` (idata.cpp) shipped WITHOUT a donor fallback — unlike `aadata.cpp` (aircraft) and `udata.cpp` (units), which both have one. A TD-prefixed infantry's SHP isn't in any MIX → `MFCD::Retrieve` returns NULL → `ImageData == NULL` → `InfantryClass::Draw_It` bails at its NULL-shape guard.

**Symptom:** the unit **builds, is selectable, plays TD voices, and shows its sidebar cameo — but renders nothing on the map.** (Buildings don't hit this; they bypass the SHP path in Remaster. Caught on TDE1 Minigunner, 2026-05-29 — invisible until the fallback was added.)

**Fix:** in `InfantryTypeClass::One_Time` after the load loop, copy a vanilla infantry donor's `ImageData`/`CameoData` (`INFANTRY_E1` for any minigunner-sized unit). The launcher's `Techno_Draw_Object` overlay then renders the real sprite by IniName from `RA_UNITS.XML`. **The donor also supplies correct render dimensions → no `ShapeSize=` is needed for infantry** (vehicles differ — they set their own). Full recipe: `docs/td-infantry-port-recipe.md`.

### 3.25 — Visible custom-bullet projectiles WHITE-BOX in the Remaster launcher (use a shared RA primitive for tumbling bombs)

**Symptom:** a fully-bundled custom bullet (donor `ImageData` + sprite ZIP + `RA_VFX.XML` tileset block — the complete TDDRAGON pattern) renders as a **white box** in flight, though arc / damage / impact are all correct.

**Root cause:** `BulletClass::Shape_Number` (`bullet.cpp:537`) returns a **facing-based shape 0-31** for any visible (non-`IsFaceless`) bullet. The launcher honors that index, so a **32-frame *rotating* bullet** (`Rotates=yes`, e.g. the TDSSM / TDDRAGON missiles) maps cleanly, but an **8-frame *tumbling* bomb white-boxes for facings 8-31** (only frames 0-7 exist).

**Fix:** match the sprite's frame model to the bullet kind.
- **Rotating missiles (32-frame):** port as their own `BULLET_TDxxx` with `Rotates=yes` — renders fine.
- **Tumbling / arcing bombs (8-frame):** **reuse RA's shared `Projectile=Lobbed`** (TD's and RA's grenade are the *same* "BOMB" sprite, so it's visually TD-authentic). Keep the TD-specific stats + `Warhead=TDxx` on the *weapon*; the bullet is non-`IsTDPort` and the impact splash comes from the warhead's `Explosion=`. Same "shared rendering primitive" logic as an invisible small-arms round reusing one `50cal`-style bullet (E2 Grenadier, 2026-05-29).

---

### 3.26 — Directional muzzle anims (FLAME jet) + the GREEN-PLACEHOLDER donor trap for HD-only anims

The TD flamethrower taught two distinct lessons. Both apply to **any** weapon whose visual is a directional *muzzle animation* rather than a flying projectile (FLAME, the SAM/GUN muzzle flashes, future chem-spray).

**(a) The flame is a muzzle ANIM, not a projectile — and it's directional.** TD's flamethrower fires an **invisible** bullet; the visible jet is one of **8 facing-specific anims** (`FLAME-N … FLAME-NW`) spawned at the muzzle. Do **not** model it on RA's `[Flamer]` (a single visible `Fireball` *projectile* — a completely different mechanism). Port it as TD does:
- Add 8 contiguous `ANIM_FLAME_N … ANIM_FLAME_NW` in **`Dir_Facing` order** (defines.h), ctors + `Init_Heap` regs in `adata.cpp`.
- In `techno.cpp::Fire_At`, dispatch the base case to the facing-offset member:
  ```cpp
  case ANIM_FLAME_N:  a = AnimType(ANIM_FLAME_N + Dir_Facing(Fire_Direction()));  break;
  ```
  **Use `Fire_Direction()`, not `PrimaryFacing.Current()`** — that's what TD does (`TECHNO.CPP:2378`); copying the SAM's `PrimaryFacing` points the jet wrong. The weapon's `Anim=` in rules.ini names only the base member (`Anim=TDFLAME-N`); the `+ Dir_Facing` math selects the rest.
- The anim is **attached** to the firer (`anim->Attach_To(this)`, `TECHNO.CPP:2389`) — *not* spawned standalone at a fixed coord.

**(b) HD-only anims with NULL `ImageData` render a GREEN PLACEHOLDER → donor-ImageData fix.** This is the §2.7 / §3.24 MFCD pattern, now proven to apply to **anims** too. The `TDFLAME-*` tiles exist only as HD launcher art (no classic SHP in any MIX), so `AnimTypeClass::One_Time` leaves `ImageData == NULL`. Unlike bullets/units (which go *invisible*), a NULL-ImageData **anim** draws a **green placeholder box**. Fix — copy a vanilla anim's `ImageData` under `#ifdef REMASTER_BUILD` (the built-in `ANIM_BEACON_VIRTUAL` does exactly this):
```cpp
#ifdef REMASTER_BUILD
    void const* flame_donor = As_Reference(ANIM_FBALL1).ImageData;
    for (int fa = ANIM_FLAME_N; fa <= ANIM_FLAME_NW; fa++) {
        if (As_Reference((AnimType)fa).ImageData == NULL) {
            ((void const*&)As_Reference((AnimType)fa).ImageData) = flame_donor;
        }
    }
#endif
```
The overlay then resolves the real `TDFLAME-<dir>` tile by IniName. **Generalises: any TD anim that is HD-tile-only needs a donor ImageData or it renders green.**

**(c) TD-prefix the anim names** (`FLAME-*` → `TDFLAME-*`: ctor names, `RA_VFX.XML` tiles + frame paths, bundled ZIPs, rules.ini `Anim=`). The base game ships its **own** `FLAME-N` tiles (78 refs in CONFIG.MEG); an unprefixed name resolves to the *base* def, not yours — same trap as `TDIONSFX`/`TDDRAGON`.

**Process note:** this took ~6 speculative deploy cycles before a one-line diagnostic log (`Anim(raw)`, `a(dir)`, `IniName`, spawned-pointer) proved the DLL side was perfect and isolated the bug to the render path — straight to (b). Ship logging in the *first* test of any new entity (see infantry recipe; memory `feedback-logs-first-on-new-units`). Shipped E4 Flamethrower, 2026-05-29.

**(d) Suppress the warhead impact-explosion (RA conflates what TD separates).** In **TD** the impact anim lives on the *bullet* (`ClassFlame`/`ClassChem` both = `ANIM_NONE` → spray weapons produce **no impact blast**, only the muzzle jet). In **RA** the impact anim is chosen from the *warhead* (`Combat_Anim` reads `Warhead->ExplosionSet`). So a non-`IsTDPort` spray bullet + any warhead with `Explosion=` 1–6 spawns an unwanted blast on every hit (the chem's HE blast, the flame's napalm puff). **Fix:** set the warhead's `Explosion=0` — `combat.cpp:373` returns `ANIM_NONE` for any `ExplosionSet` outside 1–6. If the warhead is **shared** (the chem's HE table is also the E2 grenadier's `TDHE`, which *wants* its grenade blast), make a **dedicated copy** (`TDChemWar` = TDHE verses/spread, `Explosion=0`); if it's already weapon-specific (`TDFire`), just zero it in place. This was latent in the E4 flamethrower too — caught when the E5 chem's bigger HE blast made it obvious.

**(e) Classic-mode parity: bundle the classic SHPs so the donor becomes a no-op.** The donor-`ImageData` trick (b) only fixes **HD** — in classic mode there's no overlay, so `Draw_It` renders the *donor's* classic SHP (`FBALL1` = a fireball at the muzzle, no spray). Proper fix: the original 8 directional SHPs exist in TD's `CONQUER.MIX` (`chem-n..nw`, `flame-n..nw`), so add them to `build_tfassets.sh`'s list (`CHEM-N.SHP:TDCHEM-N.SHP` …), rebuild `TFASSETS.MIX` (palette-remapped). `AnimTypeClass::One_Time` retrieves `<IniName>.SHP` → now loads the **real classic spray**, and the `FBALL1` donor falls through to a no-op. **Verify the classic SHP frame count matches the ctor `stages`** (both chem/flame = 13, matching the HD tiles) — if they differ, set `stages` (classic) vs `virtualstages` (HD) independently. No DLL change when they match — pure data.

### 3.27 — A new ENGINEER type is INERT until added to every `INFANTRY_RENOVATOR` special-case (+ faction-conditional capture)

`Infiltrate=yes` → `IsCapture` is **necessary but not sufficient**. The engineer's capture/renovate behaviour is **hardcoded to `INFANTRY_RENOVATOR`** at ~15 sites — `IsCapture` alone does nothing because the engine never reaches the generic capture path for an engineer; it dispatches on the *type*. A new engine type (e.g. `INFANTRY_TDE6`) builds, renders, paths onto the building — and then **does nothing** (falls through to the non-engineer branch). Symptom caught on TDE6, 2026-05-30: it would have shipped unable to capture.

**The sites that matter for a human-player capture (add the new type at each):**
- **Execution** — `infantry.cpp` Per_Cell_Process (`if (*this == INFANTRY_RENOVATOR)` around the renovate/capture/damage block). Without this the capture never *executes*.
- **Cursor** — `infantry.cpp::What_Action` (`if (*this == INFANTRY_RENOVATOR && ... RTTI_BUILDING ...)`). Without this the player gets no capture cursor.
- **AI capture-targeting** — `foot.cpp` (`Type == INFANTRY_RENOVATOR || ... THIEF` → `Assign_Mission(MISSION_CAPTURE)`).
- The `ACTION_CAPTURE`→`MISSION_CAPTURE` mapping and `MISSION_CAPTURE` execution loop are **generic** (not type-gated), so those need no change. Bridge-repair sites (`TEMPLATE_BRIDGE`) are RA-only — **skip** them for a TD engineer (TD had no bridge repair). `grep -n INFANTRY_RENOVATOR redalert/*.cpp` to audit; the AI-preservation / survivor sites (`house.cpp`, `cell.cpp`, `building.cpp:Crew_Type`) are deferred-AI, not capture-critical.

**Faction-conditional single-vs-multi capture** (a clean lever once the type is recognised). The Remaster uses RA's Aftermath **multi-engineer** capture (`Health_Ratio() <= EngineerCaptureLevel` gate → otherwise `EngineerDamage` and consume). To make **TD-faction engineers single-capture** (TD behaviour) while RA factions keep multi, gate on the engineer's **owner faction**, at both the execution and cursor health-checks:
```cpp
bool td_single = (House->ActLike == HOUSE_GOOD || House->ActLike == HOUSE_BAD);
if ((td_single || tech->Health_Ratio() <= EngineerCaptureLevel) && iscapturable) { /* capture */ }
```

**Capture-only (no friendly mega-repair).** RA's RENOVATOR also mega-repairs a *friendly* building (the `House->Is_Ally(...)` branch → `Renovate()` / `ACTION_GREPAIR`). TD engineers only captured. Gate that friendly branch to `*this == INFANTRY_RENOVATOR` so the TD engineer falls through (no repair action) — at both the execution and the cursor.

**Generalises:** any TD entity whose engine behaviour is dispatched by a hardcoded `INFANTRY_<X>` / `STRUCT_<X>` / `UNIT_<X>` type check (not a `TechnoTypeClass` flag) is **inert** as a new separated type until added to those checks. The C4 commando dodged this because RA *had* generalised C4 to the `IsBomber` flag — the engineer's capture was **not** generalised. Always `grep` the donor type's name across `*.cpp` before assuming a flag is enough.

## 4. Templates to copy

### 4.1 — Bullet TD-port: add field, set on registration, dispatch

**Step 1:** In `redalert/type.h`, add to `BulletTypeClass`:
```cpp
unsigned IsTDPort : 1;
```
plus any TD-source-specific fields the TD code references (we added `IsHoming`, `ClassWarhead`, `ImpactAnim`, `BulletRange`).

**Step 2:** In `redalert/bbdata.cpp`, constructor init:
```cpp
, IsTDPort(false)
, IsHoming(false)
, ClassWarhead(WARHEAD_NONE)
, ImpactAnim(ANIM_NONE)
, BulletRange(0)
```

**Step 3:** In `Read_INI`, parse the new fields:
```cpp
IsHoming = ini.Get_Bool(Name(), "Homing", IsHoming);
ClassWarhead = ini.Get_WarheadType(Name(), "Warhead", ClassWarhead);
ImpactAnim = ini.Get_AnimType(Name(), "ImpactAnim", ImpactAnim);
BulletRange = ini.Get_Int(Name(), "BulletRange", BulletRange);
```

**Step 4:** In `bbdata.cpp::Init_Heap` after the registrations:
```cpp
BulletTypes.Ptr((int)BULLET_TDxxx)->IsTDPort = true;
```

**Step 5:** In `bullet.cpp::AI` and `bullet.cpp::Unlimbo`, dispatch at top:
```cpp
if (Class->IsTDPort) { AI_TD(); return; }
// existing RA logic
```

**Step 6:** Port TD's body verbatim as `AI_TD()` / `Unlimbo_TD()` per §2.8 symbol renames.

**Step 7:** Donor ImageData per §2.7.

### 4.2 — Weapon TD-port: add field, set on registration, dispatch parse

**Step 1:** In `redalert/weapon.h`, add `unsigned IsTDPort : 1;` to `WeaponTypeClass`.

**Step 2:** In `redalert/weapon.cpp` constructor, `IsTDPort(false)`.

**Step 3:** In `WeaponTypeClass::Read_INI`, dispatch on IsTDPort for `Speed=` parsing:
```cpp
if (IsTDPort) {
    MaxSpeed = (MPHType)ini.Get_Int(Name(), "Speed", (int)MaxSpeed);
} else {
    MaxSpeed = ini.Get_MPHType(Name(), "Speed", MaxSpeed);
}
```

**Step 4:** In `rules.cpp` after `new WeaponTypeClass("TDxxx")`:
```cpp
WeaponTypeClass::As_Pointer(Weapon_From_Name("TDxxx"))->IsTDPort = true;
```

### 4.3 — `Rearm_Delay` already does the right thing

Once the weapon is `IsTDPort=true`, the existing branch in `techno.cpp:3096-3119` returns TD's timing automatically. Nothing else to do.

## 5. Final verification checklist

Before declaring a TD-entity port "100% authentic":

- [ ] Chain audit shows zero LEAKs (all sections TD-prefixed)
- [ ] Enum entries added to `defines.h` before the `_COUNT` sentinel
- [ ] Explicit `new XxxTypeClass(...)` registration in the right `data.cpp` / `rules.cpp`
- [ ] `IsTDPort = true` set after registration (for classes that have the flag)
- [ ] Donor `ImageData` pointer copied if not a building (bullet/anim/aircraft)
- [ ] Rules.ini values are TD-source raw values (with conversion comments if non-IsTDPort)
- [ ] Tileset XML patched into the CONFIG.MEG-extracted base file (full envelope)
- [ ] Asset ZIP extracted from vanilla MEG (not TD-Assets workshop), repacked with TD-prefix internals
- [ ] TD method bodies ported verbatim into `Method_TD()` variants, dispatch added at top of `Method()`
- [ ] Build succeeds (mingw cross-compile, no warnings on the ported code)
- [ ] Deploy bundles all files (~10MB+ rsync indicates fresh DLL; ~2KB indicates skipped staging — see §3.9)
- [ ] In-game smoke test: build the entity, observe firing/damage/visual/audio/death
- [ ] Side-by-side vs actual TD: behavior matches frame-by-frame

**Memory entries (load automatically per session):**
- [[project-td-port-architecture]] — Option A architecture, why it was chosen
- [[feedback-td-building-chain-audit-ritual]] — mandatory output ritual before any TD change
- [[feedback-no-donor-for-td-separation]] — no RA-implementation reuse principle
- [[reference-ra-mphtype-ini-format]] — Speed unit conversion
- [[reference-mfcd-donor-imagedata-pattern]] — donor ImageData for non-building TD entities
- [[project-mod-type-heap-sizing]] — enum + heap registration requirement
- [[project-td-audio-routing-recipe]] — SFXEVENTSNONLOCALIZED MERGE pattern
- [[project-td-prefix-convention]] — every TD entity gets TD prefix

**TD source paths (read these as the spec):**
- `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp` — building Class declarations
- `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/bbdata.cpp` — bullet Class declarations
- `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/udata.cpp` — unit Class declarations
- `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/aadata.cpp` — aircraft Class declarations

- `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/defines.h` — `MPHType` constants, `STRUCT_*`, `BULLET_*`, `WEAPON_*`, `WARHEAD_*`, `ANIM_*` enums
- `reference/vanilla-conquer/tiberiandawn/building.cpp`, `bullet.cpp`, `techno.cpp`, etc. — dispatch site bodies to port verbatim

## 7. When to update this playbook

Every time we discover a new trap or refine a pattern, append it to §3 (the traps section) with:
- **Trap:** one-sentence description
- **Symptom:** what you observe in-game
- **Fix:** the code/data change

Living document — keep it ahead of the implementation, not behind.
