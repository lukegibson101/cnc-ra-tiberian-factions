# Adding a TD building as a buildable in our RA mod

End-to-end recipe to add a new TD-themed building to the GDI or Nod faction. Verified against `NUK2` (Phase 1f, 2026-05-18) and re-verified against `TDNUKE` (v0.3 phase 3a, 2026-05-19, after the lessons below were absorbed).

## v0.3 lessons (must read before adding new entries)

Three non-obvious gotchas the recipe didn't originally cover. Skip these and the entry registers but doesn't behave correctly.

### 1. IniName collisions silently break the entry

`[NewBuildings]` registration in `rules.cpp` only creates a mod entry when `BuildingTypeClass::As_Pointer(buffer) == NULL`. So if your IniName matches a vanilla RA building (HPAD, GUN, SAM, AFLD, WEAP, FIX, PROC, SILO, FACT) the registration is skipped silently and your `[<NAME>]` section overrides the **vanilla** building instead.

Similarly, INI section names live in a flat namespace: warhead/animation/sound sections share it. `NUKE` is a vanilla RA WarheadType. If you register a building with that IniName, `[NewBuildings]` succeeds (warheads aren't BuildingTypes) but `TechnoTypeClass::Read_INI` then sees the warhead's 7 entries (`Spread`, `Wall`, `Wood`, `Ore`, `Verses`, `Explosion`, `InfDeath`) instead of your building's fields. Result: building appears in the heap with default-everything (Ownable=0, Level=-1) and never builds.

**Rule:** prefix every catalogue IniName with `TD` (e.g. `TDNUKE`, `TDPYLE`, `TDHAND`). `Image=` and `Footprint=` and the sprite ZIPs keep the unprefixed TD asset name — those don't collide.

### 2. Damaged-state shape is auto-derived from Anims[BSTATE_IDLE].Count

When `Health_Ratio() <= ConditionYellow`, `BuildingClass::Shape_Number()` shifts the rendered shape by `largest = max(Anims[*].Start + Count)` across IDLE/ACTIVE/AUX1/AUX2. So:

- **Static building (Count=1):** largest=1, shape 1 = damaged variant. The recipe's "remap shape 1 to nuke-0004.tga" trick works here.
- **Animated building (Count=N):** largest=N, shape N = damaged variant of shape 0, shape N+1 = damaged of shape 1, etc. **Do NOT remap shape 1** — it's a normal idle frame in the cycle. The TGA frames are already laid out 0..N-1 normal, N..2N-1 damaged; the engine handles the shift automatically.

### 3. Mod entries don't inherit the donor's idle animation

`Logic=POWR` inherits POWR's BuildingTypeClass static fields (Size, OccupyList, ImageData, etc.) and POWR's Anims[]. But POWR has no idle anim entry in the hardcoded `_anims[]` table in `One_Time()`, so Anims[BSTATE_IDLE] is `{0, 1, 0}` (static). For a TD building with a cyclic idle (NUKE blinks, PYLE animates, HQ rotates dish), set rules.ini override fields:

```ini
IdleAnimStart=0
IdleAnimCount=4
IdleAnimRate=15
```

Per-building TD-authentic values are in the master flag table in `docs/catalogue.md`. The override is applied after Logic= aliasing in `BuildingTypeClass::Read_INI`.

### 4. Crewed / Repairable inherit from neither

`TechnoTypeClass::Read_INI` parses `Crewed=` and `Repairable=` from rules.ini, defaulting to the current value. For mod entries the current value is the dynamic ctor default (false / unset). Vanilla buildings get these from their `[POWR]`-style rules.ini section. So you must set `Crewed=yes` and `Repairable=yes` (or per-building TD values) explicitly in every entry, otherwise sell/destroy produces no infantry and the wrench-tool can't target the building.

Per-building TD-authentic Crewed/Repairable/Capturable values: see master flag table in `docs/catalogue.md`. Notably: SILO/HPAD/SAM are Crew=no (TD canon); GTWR/ATWR/OBLI/GUN/SAM/EYE/TMPL are Capturable=no.

## What "adding" means here

A new `[NewBuildings]` entry in our mod's `CCDATA/rules.ini` that the engine treats as a Logic-aliased clone of a vanilla RA building (POWR, BARR, etc.) for behaviour, but presents to the player with custom identity:

- Custom sidebar icon
- Custom display name (e.g. "GDIPowerPlant")
- Custom cost / power / strength
- TD building sprite on the map (buildup → idle → damaged)
- TD building's actual placement footprint shape
- Configurable Owner= to restrict to GDI or Nod

The engine still thinks it's a power plant (or whatever donor we picked) — that's how we get factory queueing, prerequisite handling, AI behaviour, and crew/death mechanics for free.

## Pre-flight: identify the donor and the TD source

For each building, decide:

1. **Donor** — the closest vanilla RA building whose engine behaviour we want. POWR for power plants, BARR/TENT for barracks, PROC for refineries, etc. (See `tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp` for the full RA BuildingType list.)
2. **TD asset name** — the TD building's IniName. This is also our entry's IniName (e.g. `NUK2`, `HAND`, `PYLE`).
3. **TD footprint** — look up the TD building's Size/OccupyList/OverlapList in `tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp`.

## Step 1: rules.ini entry

In the mod's `CCDATA/rules.ini`:

```ini
[NewBuildings]
1=NUK2
; add more here as you build out the faction

[NUK2]
Logic=POWR             ; engine behaviour donor
Image=NUK2             ; sprite + buildup asset name (matches the TD IniName)
Footprint=NUK2         ; named preset; must exist in bdata.cpp's _presets[] table
Name=GDIPowerPlant     ; display name (case can be styled)
TechLevel=1
Owner=allies           ; or soviet, or eventually good/bad for GDI/Nod
Cost=350
Power=100              ; +100 = generates; -N = consumes
Sight=3
Adjacent=1
Strength=400
Armor=wood
BaseNormal=yes
Capturable=true
Bib=yes
```

Notes on field choices:
- `Owner=allies` includes HOUSE_GOOD via `HOUSEF_ALLIES` (per `defines.h:1158`). For GDI as eventual standalone faction, switch to `good` once `HOUSEF_GOOD` is its own owner set.
- The `[NewBuildings]` ordinal (1, 2, …) is the entry order. The DLL's dynamic ctor uses `BuildingTypes.Count() - 1` as the actual heap slot, not the ordinal, so ordinal values don't matter beyond uniqueness within the section.

## Step 2: RA_Structures.xml tile entries

Copy the TD building's `<Tile>` blocks from vanilla `TD_Structures.xml` (extracted via `scripts/meg_extract.py` from `CONFIG.MEG`) into the mod's `Data/XML/TILESETS/RA_STRUCTURES.XML`.

The blocks include both `<Name>NUK2</Name>` (idle shapes 0-N) and `<Name>NUK2MAKE</Name>` (buildup animation shapes). Insert them inside the existing `<TilesetTypeClass name="RA_Structures"><Tiles>...</Tiles>` block, before the closing `</Tiles>`.

The mod's RA_Structures.xml is wholesale-loaded by the launcher when present (no merge with vanilla). It must include the full vanilla RA tile list + your additions.

Workflow:

```bash
# Extract vanilla files (one-time)
python3 scripts/meg_extract.py extract ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/CnCRemastered/Data/CONFIG.MEG "RA_STRUCTURES.XML" /tmp/vanilla-xml/
python3 scripts/meg_extract.py extract ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/CnCRemastered/Data/CONFIG.MEG "TD_STRUCTURES.XML" /tmp/vanilla-xml/

# Extract the TD building's Tile blocks (NUK2 example)
awk '/<Tile>/{block=""; in_tile=1} in_tile{block=block$0"\n"} /<\/Tile>/{ if (block ~ /<Name>NUK2(MAKE)?<\/Name>/) printf "%s", block; in_tile=0; block="" }' /tmp/vanilla-xml/TD_STRUCTURES.XML > /tmp/td-blocks.xml

# Insert into mod's RA_Structures.xml before the closing </Tiles></TilesetTypeClass>
# (manual or scripted edit)
```

### Damaged shape remap (recommended)

After buildup, the engine renders shape 0 for full-health and shape 1 for damaged (when Health_Ratio <= ConditionYellow, per `BuildingClass::Shape_Number()`). Vanilla TD's tile blocks have shape 1 as the next frame of idle, not a damaged variant. To get a proper damaged sprite, remap the entry's `<Shape>1</Shape>` Frame to point at the TD damaged frame (usually index 4):

```xml
<Tile>
    <Key><Name>NUK2</Name><Shape>1</Shape></Key>
    <Value><Frames><Frame>nuk2\nuk2-0004.tga</Frame></Frames></Value>
</Tile>
```

Verify by viewing the frame TGAs after extracting the ZIP — TD's convention is frames 0-3 normal/idle, 4+ damaged.

### Don't fill NUK2MAKE shape 0

Vanilla TD's MAKE tile blocks have shape 0 as `<Frame />` (empty). That's intentional — it's the placement marker before buildup starts. Filling it causes the completed sprite to flash for a frame before buildup begins, which looks broken. Leave shape 0 empty.

## Step 3: Ship the sprite ZIPs

Extract the TD building's idle and buildup ZIPs from the vanilla TD PAK:

```bash
python3 scripts/meg_extract.py extract ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/CnCRemastered/Data/TEXTURES_TD_SRGB.MEG "NUK2" /tmp/nuk2-zips/
# Produces: NUK2.ZIP, NUK2MAKE.ZIP
```

Copy to the mod's `Data/ART/TEXTURES/SRGB/RED_ALERT/STRUCTURES/` (note: RA path, not TD — the launcher in RA mode resolves asset paths under current-game's root). Same convention as Reilsss's mod.

The ZIPs contain `<name>-NNNN.tga` files at root, which the launcher resolves via the tile entry's `<Frame>name\name-NNNN.tga</Frame>` path (the ZIP basename becomes the path segment).

## Step 4: Footprint preset in bdata.cpp

The Logic= donor inherits Size/OccupyList/OverlapList from POWR (or whatever donor), which won't match the TD building's actual shape. Override via the `Footprint=` named preset.

In `redalert/bdata.cpp` `BuildingTypeClass::Read_INI`, find the `_presets[]` table after the Logic= block and add an entry. Use TD's static list arrays as a reference for the shape:

```cpp
// Defined alongside the existing presets:
static short const List_HAND_OCCUPY[]  = {0, 1, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_HAND_OVERLAP[] = {REFRESH_EOL};

static FootprintPreset const _presets[] = {
    {"NUK2", BSIZE_22, List_NUK2_OCCUPY, List_NUK2_OVERLAP},
    {"HAND", BSIZE_22, List_HAND_OCCUPY, List_HAND_OVERLAP},  // ← new entry
    // ...
};
```

The lists come from `tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp`. Most TD buildings use shared lists like `List1011` (which is `{0, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, REFRESH_EOL}`) — you can copy the literal array contents, or define a single shared static and reference it from multiple presets.

Rebuild the DLL after adding a preset.

## Step 5: Sidebar XML entry

In the mod's `Data/XML/OBJECTS/UNITS/RABUILDABLES.XML`, append:

```xml
<ObjectTypeClass Name="RA_NUK2" Classification="CNCBuildableObject" CanInstantiate="False">
    <CNCEncyclopediaComponent>
        <ObjectNameTextID>TEXT_STRUCTURE_TITLE_GDI_POWER_PLANT</ObjectNameTextID>
        <ObjectDescriptionTextID>TEXT_STRUCTURE_DESC_GDI_POWER_PLANT</ObjectDescriptionTextID>
        <BuildIcon>BuildIcon_TD_PowerPlant</BuildIcon>
    </CNCEncyclopediaComponent>
</ObjectTypeClass>
```

The Name is `RA_<IniName>` — the launcher prepends the game-prefix automatically.

`<BuildIcon>` references a `BuildIcon_*.tga` filename. For TD buildings, vanilla TD's BuildIcon names work (e.g. `BuildIcon_TD_PowerPlant`, `BuildIcon_TD_HandOfNod`). The launcher's PAK contains these icons; no shipping needed unless we want a custom icon.

Text IDs can be vanilla too (`TEXT_STRUCTURE_TITLE_GDI_POWER_PLANT` already exists in the launcher's localized text). For custom names, ship a text override XML.

## Step 6: Test loop

```bash
# Build DLL (only if you added a Footprint preset)
CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/i686-mingw-w64-toolchain.cmake VC_CXX_FLAGS="-w;-fpermissive" cmake --workflow --preset remaster

# Deploy to Steam Deck
scp build/remaster/Vanilla_RA/Data/RedAlert.dll deck@steamdeck:/home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1213210/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/CnCRemastered/Mods/Red_Alert/<mod-name>/Data/RedAlert.dll

# Data files (rules.ini, XML, ZIPs)
scp -r CCDATA Data deck@steamdeck:/home/deck/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1213210/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/CnCRemastered/Mods/Red_Alert/<mod-name>/
```

Restart the game, build the new entry from the sidebar, check:

- Sidebar icon + display name + cost match
- Buildup animation plays correctly
- Idle sprite renders (TD-style)
- Damaged variant appears when attacked
- Placement footprint matches TD's actual shape
- Multiple instances can coexist with vanilla buildings

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Entry doesn't appear in sidebar | Owner= doesn't match player's house, or Prerequisite= not satisfied | Check `Owner=` vs current house, lower TechLevel, remove Prerequisite |
| Click on completed sidebar entry → cancels with "Cannot Comply" | Who_Can_Build_Me fails (Construction Yard's ActLike doesn't match Ownable) | Check Owner= bitmask covers the player's ActLike |
| Buildup plays, then invisible building | ImageData NULL | Verify `Logic=<donor>` is set and donor exists |
| Building visible but no damaged state | NUK2 shape 1 still points at idle frame | Remap to damaged frame in RA_Structures.xml |
| Premature sprite reveal before buildup | NUK2MAKE shape 0 has a real Frame instead of `<Frame />` | Restore empty `<Frame />` |
| Placement grid wrong shape | Inheriting donor's footprint, no preset override | Add `Footprint=<name>` to rules.ini + matching preset to bdata.cpp |
| `TileMapClass: Missing tile for <NAME>` in launcher log | Tile entries not in mod's RA_Structures.xml | Add `<Tile>` blocks from TD_Structures.xml |
| Launcher log shows `Failed to find texture "<name>-0000.tga"` | ZIP not shipped at RA path, or filename mismatch | Verify ZIP at `Red_Alert\Structures\<NAME>.ZIP` with `<name>-NNNN.tga` inside |

## Diagnostic re-enable

If you hit a new failure mode and need DLL-side visibility, all diagnostic hooks from the 2026-05-18 session are documented inline with `// Diagnostic hook removed 2026-05-18` comments showing where to re-insert and what to log. Search for the comment to find re-enable points.

Use absolute Wine path `C:\users\steamuser\Documents\CnCRemastered\MOD_DEBUG.txt` for fopen — relative paths fail silently under Wine.

Rate-limit per-frame logs (e.g., `static int count; if (count++ < 60)`) to avoid flooding.
