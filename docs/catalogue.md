# Building catalogue — Tiberian Factions for Red Alert

Design spec for the new buildings we're adding via the Logic-aliased mod-building pipeline (see `docs/adding-td-buildings.md` for the per-building implementation recipe). Stats below are pulled from `tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp` — TD-authentic by default.

## Session pickup

**Current state (end of 2026-05-19 evening session):**
- v0.3 baseline pulled from Deck into `resources/remaster_mods/Vanilla_RA/` (committed source tree).
- Manual NUKE entry implemented + Deck-verified end-to-end (sidebar icon, cost, TD sprite, 2×2 footprint, buildup → idle animation cycling 0-3, damaged variant via auto-shift to shapes 4-7, sell/destroy spawns crew). See [[v0_3_phase3a_findings]].
- **Two non-obvious lessons baked in below:**
  1. **IniName collisions.** Vanilla RA building IniNames (HPAD, GUN, SAM, AFLD, WEAP, FIX, PROC, SILO, FACT) AND warhead/section names (NUKE, etc.) live in the same INI namespace. Using a collision IniName silently skips the mod-entry registration. **Mandatory TD prefix on all catalogue IniNames** (`TDNUKE`, `TDPYLE`, etc.).
  2. **Damaged-state shapes auto-derive from idle anim.** For `Anims[BSTATE_IDLE].Count == N`, the engine renders shapes `0..N-1` as normal and shapes `N..2N-1` as damaged. So a Count=1 building has shape 1 = damaged (the recipe's original assumption); a Count=4 building has shape 4 = damaged. **Don't remap shape 1 to a damage frame unless the building is static (Count=1).**

**Where to start next session:** **Phase 1 of v0.3** — GDI catalogue buildout via `scripts/add_building.py`.
1. Write the helper script keyed off the master flag table below.
2. Run for each catalogue entry. NUKE is done (reference implementation).
3. Then NUK2 (Phase 1 POC value migration), PYLE, HQ, WEAP, FIX, GTWR, ATWR, HPAD, EYE for GDI catalogue.

**Testbed state on the Deck (`Red_Alert/tiberian-factions-emc-test/`):**
- v0.3 DLL + TDNUKE deployed and verified.
- `Red_Alert/Vanilla_RA/` is the intended v0.3 final deploy path; the testbed remains for rapid iteration.

## Master flag table (TD-authentic, v0.3 source of truth)

Per-building flags extracted from `tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp`. These are the values `add_building.py` reads. **IniName** is the catalogue IniName (TD-prefixed); **Image/Footprint/sprite ZIPs** keep the unprefixed TD asset names.

| IniName | Faction | Donor | Cost | Power | HP | Sight | Adj | Armor | Bib | Cap | Crew | Repair | Idle:Start/Count/Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| TDGTWR | GDI   | PBOX | 500  | -10  | 200  | 3 | 1 | wood     | no  | **no** | yes | yes | —     | TD lvl 2, 1×1 |
| TDATWR | GDI   | AGUN | 1000 | -20  | 300  | 4 | 1 | aluminum | no  | **no** | yes | yes | —     | TD lvl 4, 1×2 |
| TDOBLI | Nod   | TSLA | 1500 | -150 | 200  | 5 | 1 | aluminum | no  | **no** | yes | yes | —     | TD lvl 4, 1×2, ACTIVE 0/4/RATE |
| TDGUN  | Nod   | GUN  | 600  | -20  | 200  | 5 | 1 | steel    | no  | **no** | yes | yes | —     | TD lvl 2, 1×1 |
| TDSAM  | Nod   | SAM  | 750  | -20  | 200  | 3 | 1 | steel    | no  | **no** | **no** | yes | — | TD lvl 6, 2×1, turret-based |
| TDFACT | both  | FACT | 5000 | -30  | 400  | 3 | 1 | wood     | yes | yes | yes | yes | 0/4/3   | TD lvl 99, ACTIVE 4/20/3 — closing v0.3 slice |

**Reading the table:**
- Empty `Idle` column = no idle animation (engine renders shape 0 statically). Damaged state = shape 1 in that case (the engine's `largest = max(Anims[*].Start + Count) = 1` auto-shift).
- `Crew=no` means selling/destroying spawns zero infantry (TD canon for SILO/HPAD/SAM).
- `Cap=no` (bold) marks entries where TD authentic differs from the original catalogue spec — defensive structures and superweapon hosts can't be captured. **TMPL and EYE are NOT capturable per TD.**
- Logic= aliases the engine donor; field overrides come via rules.ini per the recipe.

## Per-entry sections — design rationale

The sections below capture **design rationale and donor choice** for each catalogue entry. The flag values shown in per-entry field tables are illustrative — the **master flag table above is the canonical source** the script reads. Where they disagree, the master table wins.

Entry names below use the TD asset name (e.g. "PYLE", "HAND") for readability; the actual IniName in rules.ini is TD-prefixed (`TDPYLE`, `TDHAND`, etc.) to avoid the vanilla-RA collision class documented in `docs/adding-td-buildings.md`.

## GDI catalogue

GDI: Allied-flavoured engine donors where there's a choice. Armoured, ordered, Western.

### PYLE — GDI Barracks 📝
Faction: GDI · Donor: **TENT** (Allied barracks) · TD lvl 0, $300, -20 power, 400 HP, 2×2 wood, prereq NUKE

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | TENT |
| Image= | PYLE |
| Footprint= | PYLE (2×2, to add) |
| Name= | Barracks |
| TechLevel | 0 |

| Strength | 400 |
| Armor | wood |
| Sight | 3 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | yes |

**Note:** GDI inherits Allied infantry roster (GI, Rocket Soldier, Engineer, Medic, Spy, Tanya) via the TENT donor for v0.3. Custom GDI infantry types are v0.4+.

### HPAD — Helipad 📝
Faction: **both** · Donor: **HPAD** · TD lvl 6, $1500, -10 power, 400 HP, 2×2 wood, prereq Barracks

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | HPAD |
| Image= | HPAD |
| Footprint= | HPAD (2×2) |
| Name= | Helipad |
| TechLevel | 6 |
| Prerequisite | PYLE\|HAND |
| Owner= | GoodGuy,BadGuy |
| Cost | 1500 |
| Power | -10 |
| Strength | 400 |
| Armor | wood |
| Sight | 3 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | yes |

**Note:** Both factions share HPAD per TD canon (GDI Orca, Nod Apache). Helicopter roster inherits from HPAD donor — RA Longbow for Allied-side, Hind for Soviet-side. TD-flavoured helicopters land in v0.4 with the unit roster work.

### HQ — Communications Center / Radar 📝
Faction: **both** · Donor: **DOME** · TD lvl 2, $1000, -40 power, 500 HP, 2×2 wood, sight **10**, prereq PROC

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | DOME |
| Image= | HQ |
| Footprint= | HQ (2×2) |
| Name= | Communications Center |
| TechLevel | 2 |
| Prerequisite | PROC |
| Owner= | GoodGuy,BadGuy |
| Cost | 1000 |
| Power | -40 |
| Strength | 500 |
| Armor | wood |
| Sight | 10 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | yes |

**Note:** TD didn't differentiate visually — both factions shared HQ. Single shared entry.

### EYE — Advanced Communications Center (hosts Ion Cannon) 📝 🚧
Faction: GDI · Donor: **MSLO** (RA Missile Silo — for superweapon hosting) · TD lvl 7, $2800, -**200** power, 500 HP, 2×2 wood, sight 10, prereq HQ

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | MSLO |
| Image= | EYE |
| Footprint= | EYE (2×2) |
| Name= | Advanced Communications Center |

| Strength | 500 |
| Armor | wood |
| Sight | 10 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | yes |

**Design (2026-05-19):** EYE is GDI's superweapon host — building it grants the Ion Cannon strike. Mirrors Nod's TMPL (Temple of Nod hosts nuclear strike). Use Logic=MSLO so the engine grants a generic superweapon timer/picker.

**🚧 v0.3 caveat:** MSLO's default superweapon is the Atom Bomb visual (mushroom cloud). The actual Ion Cannon beam-strike effect is a separate engine implementation in v0.4. For v0.3, EYE grants a working superweapon with placeholder visuals — the mechanic works, the art doesn't match yet.

**-200 power drain** is huge — players will need NUK2 (or two NUKEs) to support EYE. TD's design intent.

### GTWR — Guard Tower 📝
Faction: GDI · Donor: **PBOX** (Allied Pillbox) · TD lvl 2, $500, -10 power, 200 HP, **1×1** wood, prereq PYLE

| Field | Value |

| Strength | 200 |
| Armor | wood |
| Sight | 3 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | no (1×1 = no bib) |

### ATWR — Advanced Guard Tower 📝
Faction: GDI · Donor: **AGUN** (Anti-Aircraft Gun) or **GUN** · TD lvl 4, $1000, -20 power, 300 HP, **1×2** aluminum, prereq HQ

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | AGUN |

| Footprint= | ATWR (1×2, to add) |
| Name= | Advanced Guard Tower |
| TechLevel | 4 |

| Strength | 300 |
| Armor | aluminum |
| Sight | 4 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | no |

**Donor choice:** TD's ATWR fires rockets at both ground & air. AGUN (anti-air only) is closer to the "anti-air rocket" feel. Alternative: GUN (anti-vehicle gun) for a pure anti-ground tower. Pick **AGUN** as default — TD's ATWR was anti-air-capable.

## Nod catalogue

Nod: Soviet-flavoured engine donors. Aggressive, asymmetric, distinctive defence.

### HAND — Hand of Nod (barracks) 📝
Faction: Nod · Donor: **BARR** (Soviet barracks) · TD lvl 0, $300, -20 power, 400 HP, **2×3** wood, prereq NUKE

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | BARR |

| Strength | 400 |
| Armor | wood |
| Sight | 3 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | yes |

**Note:** Footprint is 2×3 (BSIZE_23) — bigger than PYLE's 2×2. Nod barracks: Conscript, Grenadier, Engineer, Spy, Tesla Trooper, Flamethrower via BARR donor.

### GUN — Nod Gun Turret 📝
Faction: Nod · Donor: **GUN** (Allied Turret) · TD lvl 2, $600, -20 power, 200 HP, **1×1** steel, prereq HAND

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | GUN |

| Strength | 200 |
| Armor | steel |
| Sight | 5 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | no |

**Note:** Same IniName as RA's GUN — but our entry shadows the donor via Logic=. Display name disambiguates ("Nod Turret" vs "Turret").

### SAM — SAM Site (Nod anti-air) 📝
Faction: Nod · Donor: **SAM** (RA's own SAM) · TD lvl 6, $750, -20 power, 200 HP, **2×1** steel, prereq HAND

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | SAM |

| Strength | 200 |
| Armor | steel |
| Sight | 3 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | no |

**Donor choice:** SAM (donor = SAM) makes the engine pop-up missile launcher fire. Alternative: AGUN for continuous fire. Stick with SAM-as-donor for the iconic pop-up feel.

### OBLI — Obelisk of Light 📝
Faction: Nod · Donor: **TSLA** · TD lvl 4, $1500, -**150** power, 200 HP, **1×2** aluminum, prereq HQ

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | TSLA |
| Image= | OBLI |

| Strength | 200 |
| Armor | aluminum |
| Sight | 5 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | no |

**Note:** -150 power drain is the design tax for the devastating weapon. Matches TD's design — Obelisk-spam is gated by power.

### AFLD — Nod Airstrip (vehicle factory with cargo-plane delivery) 📝 🚧
Faction: Nod · Donor: **WEAP** (TD's Airstrip is Nod's vehicle factory) · TD lvl 2, $2000, -30 power, 500 HP, **4×2** steel, prereq PROC, **is_factory=yes**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Logic= | WEAP |

| Strength | 500 |
| Armor | steel |
| Sight | 5 |
| Adjacent | 1 |
| Factory | yes |
| BaseNormal | yes |
| Capturable | true |
| Bib | yes |

**Design (2026-05-19):** TD-faithful split — GDI=WEAP, Nod=AFLD. Both Logic=WEAP so both behave as vehicle factories. Same vehicle roster (whatever WEAP donor produces) until v0.4 brings TD-flavoured tanks.

**Engine work needed (scoped for v0.3, in Nod's portion of the build):**

1. **Exit cell for 4×2 footprint.** WEAP's `ExitList[0]` offset assumes a 3×3 footprint and lands south of row 2. For AFLD's 4×2 it may land inside or beyond the AFLD cells. Test first — if WEAP's offset works for 4×2 (lucky alignment), no change needed. If not, add an `ExitList=` rules.ini override field analogous to the existing `Footprint=` pipeline (1 small DLL change in `BuildingTypeClass::Read_INI`).

2. **Cargo plane delivery mechanic.** Replace the "vehicle teleports to exit coord" behaviour with TD-style "cargo plane flies in → lands → vehicle drives off → plane departs." Engine work in `BuildingClass::Exit_Object` (`redalert/building.cpp:2030`):
   - Add a check at the start of `case STRUCT_WEAP` (or earlier): if the BuildingTypeClass has an `IsAirDelivered=yes` flag (new rules.ini field), take the air-delivery path instead.
   - Air-delivery path: spawn a cargo aircraft (new TD AircraftType, donor=BADGER or new) at the closest map edge, carrying the unit as cargo. Aircraft mission flies to the AFLD's center cell, lands (similar to HPAD's `Helper_Find_Cell` for helicopter landing), unloads the vehicle (similar to existing transport-unload code), then takes off and exits the map.
   - Plumbing: `AircraftClass::Paradrop_Cargo` exists for infantry; vehicle delivery follows the same general arc but needs new code for the "land and unload vehicle" step (RA's Hind/Chinook transport unload is the closest existing path).
   - Asset: TD's cargo plane sprite (`CARGO.ZIP` from `TEXTURES_TD_SRGB.MEG`).

**Timing:** Don't block. GDI catalogue (NUKE/NUK2/PYLE/HQ/EYE/WEAP/FIX/GTWR/ATWR/HPAD) ships first using the existing Logic-aliased pipeline. When we move into Nod's portion (HAND/GUN/SAM/OBLI/TMPL), AFLD becomes its own focused slice with the two engine pieces above. Estimated 1-2 sessions for the air-delivery work, then AFLD plugs in like any other catalogue entry.

### TMPL — Temple of Nod (superweapon) 📝 🚧
Faction: Nod · Donor: **MSLO** (RA Missile Silo) · TD lvl 7, $3000, -150 power, **1000** HP, 3×3 aluminum, prereq HQ

**Note:** TMPL fires Nod's nuclear strike in TD. MSLO is RA's Atom Bomb (functionally identical superweapon — long cooldown, launch animation, target picker). 🚧 because superweapon behaviour through Logic= aliasing isn't verified.

**Direction (locked 2026-05-19):** v0.3 builds out the standalone TD buildings first, then closes with the MCV+CY pair as the final v0.3 slice. We can't keep starting in a vanilla RA con yard — the visual mismatch is too jarring once the rest of the base is TD-themed.

**Sequencing:** TD buildings (NUKE, NUK2, PROC, SILO, PYLE, HAND, HQ, WEAP, AFLD, EYE, TMPL, FIX, GTWR, ATWR, OBLI, GUN, SAM, HPAD) → then MCV/CY pair → ship v0.3.

**Engine work for MCV/CY pair (v0.3 closing slice):**
- Add `GDIMCV` / `NODMCV` unit types via the Logic-aliased pipeline (extends pipeline from BuildingType to UnitType — pipeline hasn't been validated for units yet, that's prereq work).
- Modify MCV deploy logic so it creates the faction-appropriate CY type by reading Owner (or a new field on UnitTypeClass like `DeploysInto=`).
- Modify initial-units placement in `house.cpp` so GDI/Nod players start with their respective MCV instead of the vanilla one.
- New CY entries above are then the deploy targets.

This is one cohesive slice — likely a 1-2 session implementation.

## Design decisions log

All seven of the original open questions were resolved 2026-05-19:

1. ✅ **HPAD** — both factions share, Owner=GoodGuy,BadGuy.
2. ✅ **HQ** — both factions share, Owner=GoodGuy,BadGuy.
3. ✅ **WEAP/AFLD vehicle factory** — TD-faithful split. GDI=WEAP, Nod=AFLD, both Logic=WEAP. Nod's cargo-plane delivery is a 🚧 sub-task.
4. ✅ **Infantry rosters** — v0.3 accepts donor rosters (GDI=Allied infantry via TENT, Nod=Soviet infantry via BARR). TD-flavoured infantry types come in v0.4 using the Logic-aliased pipeline extended to InfantryType.
5. ✅ **Vehicle rosters** — same approach as #4. v0.3 uses WEAP donor roster; TD vehicles in v0.4. **Exception: MCV** — needed in v0.3 to pair with the TD CY.
6. ✅ **GDI superweapon** — Ion Cannon, hosted on EYE (Logic=MSLO). Placeholder mushroom-cloud visual in v0.3; proper Ion Cannon beam in v0.4.
7. ✅ **Walls** — reuse vanilla RA walls (SBAG/CYCL/BRIK/FENC) for v0.3.

## v0.3 implementation sequence

1. **GDI catalogue buildings** — NUKE, NUK2, PYLE, HQ, WEAP, FIX, GTWR, ATWR, HPAD, EYE. Pure content; use existing Logic-aliased pipeline. Helper script worth writing here.
2. **Nod catalogue buildings + AFLD engine slice** — HAND, GUN, SAM, OBLI, TMPL, plus the AFLD air-delivery engine work (ExitList override + cargo-plane mechanic in `Exit_Object`). AFLD is the Nod vehicle factory, so it lands with the rest of Nod's tree.
3. **TD MCV/CY pair (closing slice)** — adds Logic-aliased UnitType support, GDI/Nod MCV variants, faction-aware deploy logic, faction-specific CYs.
4. **v0.3 release** — TD-themed bases, fully playable skirmish on the Deck, vanilla-RA art only on infantry/non-Nod vehicles. Workshop publish (or wait until v0.4).

## v0.4+ roadmap (not yet specced)

- TD-themed infantry per faction (Minigunner, Engineer, Grenadier, Flamethrower, etc.).
- TD-themed vehicles per faction (Light Tank, Medium Tank, Mammoth Tank, Buggy, Recon Bike, etc.).
- Ion Cannon proper visual effect (engine work).
- TD-themed walls (if v0.3's vanilla-walls compromise feels wrong).
- TD-themed Hospital / Bio Lab if there's player demand.

## Footprint presets — ready to paste into `redalert/bdata.cpp`

Each TD building needs a `Footprint=` preset registered in the `_presets[]` table in `BuildingTypeClass::Read_INI` (currently around line 3780). The shapes below are decoded from `tiberiandawn/bdata.cpp` — TD uses `MCW` (Map Cell Width), RA's equivalent is `MAP_CELL_W`. Substitution is mechanical.

**Shared shapes:** HQ, EYE, NUKE, NUK2 all share the same 2×2 L-shape (3-cell occupy + 1-cell overlap). GTWR and GUN share 1×1. ATWR and OBLI share 1×2.

### Static array declarations

```cpp
// 2×2 L-shape (3 occupied + 1 visual overlap) — shared by NUKE, NUK2, HQ, EYE
static short const List_NUK2_OCCUPY[]  = {0, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, REFRESH_EOL};        // existing
static short const List_NUK2_OVERLAP[] = {1, REFRESH_EOL};                                     // existing
// (NUKE/HQ/EYE can reference these directly via aliasing in _presets[].)

// 2×2 split (top occupied, bottom overlap) — PYLE
static short const List_PYLE_OCCUPY[]  = {0, 1, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_PYLE_OVERLAP[] = {MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, REFRESH_EOL};

// 2×3 — HAND (Nod barracks, bigger than PYLE)
static short const List_HAND_OCCUPY[]  = {MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 1, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_HAND_OVERLAP[] = {0, 1, MAP_CELL_W * 2, MAP_CELL_W, REFRESH_EOL};

// 2×2 full-fill — HPAD
static short const List_HPAD_OCCUPY[]  = {0, 1, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, REFRESH_EOL};

// 3×3 — PROC, WEAP, TMPL, FIX (different shapes per building)
static short const List_PROC_OCCUPY[]  = {1, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W + 2, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_PROC_OVERLAP[] = {0, 2, MAP_CELL_W * 2, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 1, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 2, REFRESH_EOL};

static short const List_WEAP_OCCUPY[]  = {MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W + 2,
                                          MAP_CELL_W * 2, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 1, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 2, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_WEAP_OVERLAP[] = {0, 1, 2, REFRESH_EOL};

static short const List_TMPL_OCCUPY[]  = {MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W + 2,
                                          MAP_CELL_W * 2, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 1, MAP_CELL_W * 2 + 2, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_TMPL_OVERLAP[] = {0, 1, 2, REFRESH_EOL};

static short const List_FIX_OCCUPY[]   = {1, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W + 2,
                                          MAP_CELL_W + MAP_CELL_W + 1, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_FIX_OVERLAP[]  = {0, 2, MAP_CELL_W + MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + MAP_CELL_W + 2, REFRESH_EOL};

// 3×2 — FACT (note: opposite orientation from 2×3 HAND)
static short const List_FACT_OCCUPY[]  = {0, 1, 2, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W + 2, REFRESH_EOL};

// 4×2 — AFLD (big!)
static short const List_AFLD_OCCUPY[]  = {0, 1, 2, 3, MAP_CELL_W, MAP_CELL_W + 1, MAP_CELL_W + 2, MAP_CELL_W + 3, REFRESH_EOL};

// 2×1 — SILO, SAM
static short const List_SILO_OCCUPY[]  = {0, 1, REFRESH_EOL};

static short const List_SAM_OCCUPY[]   = {0, 1, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_SAM_OVERLAP[]  = {-MAP_CELL_W, -(MAP_CELL_W - 1), REFRESH_EOL};
// ⚠️ SAM's overlap uses NEGATIVE offsets — extends above the bounding box. Verify renderer handles this in RA.

// 1×2 — ATWR, OBLI
static short const List_ATWR_OCCUPY[]  = {MAP_CELL_W, REFRESH_EOL};
static short const List_ATWR_OVERLAP[] = {0, REFRESH_EOL};

// 1×1 — GTWR, GUN
static short const List_1x1_OCCUPY[]   = {0, REFRESH_EOL};
```

### `_presets[]` table entries

```cpp
static FootprintPreset const _presets[] = {
    {"NUKE", BSIZE_22, List_NUK2_OCCUPY,  List_NUK2_OVERLAP},   // shares NUK2's L-shape

## Workflow per entry

1. Pick decisions for the entry (faction, donor, stats — all decided above for v0.3).
2. Run the 6-step recipe in `docs/adding-td-buildings.md`.
3. Update status: 📝 → 🔨 (built, untested) → ✅ (Deck-verified).
