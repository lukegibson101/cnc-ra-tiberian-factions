# Tiberian Factions — rebuild TFASSETS.MIX from TD's CONQUER.MIX.
#
# mix_tools.py pack does NOT merge with the existing archive; it rebuilds
# from scratch. This script captures the canonical TD-prefixed SHP list
# so adding a new separated building means appending one line below and
# re-running.
#
# Each TD SHP is palette-remapped for RA classic-graphics mode before
# packing: TD's house-colour range (176-191) is moved onto RA's (80-95) so
# the engine recolours it per player, and every other index is matched to
# RA's nearest palette colour. Without this, TD sprites render with wrong
# colours in classic mode (the bug Reilsss/EMC never solved).
#
# Run: bash scripts/build_tfassets.sh
