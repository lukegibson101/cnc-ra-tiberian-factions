# Tiberian Factions — rebuild TFASSETS.MIX from TD's CONQUER.MIX.
#
# mix_tools.py pack does NOT merge with the existing archive; it rebuilds
# from scratch. This script captures the canonical TD-prefixed SHP list
# so adding a new separated building means appending one line below and
# re-running.

# Run: bash scripts/build_tfassets.sh
